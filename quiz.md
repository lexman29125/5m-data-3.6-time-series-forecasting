### Q1: What are the three main components of time-series data?

- A. Mean, median, and mode
- B. Trend, seasonality, and cycle
- C. Observation, prediction, and error
- D. Past, present, and future

### Q2: What is the primary difference between seasonal and cyclic patterns in time series data?

- A. Seasonal patterns have larger amplitude than cyclic patterns
- B. Cyclic patterns occur only in economic data
- C. Seasonal patterns have fixed frequency tied to the calendar, while cyclic patterns don't have fixed frequency
- D. Cyclic patterns are always shorter in duration than seasonal patterns

### Q3: Which visualization technique is specifically used to check for autocorrelation in a time series?

- A. Time series plot
- B. Seasonal plot
- C. Subseries plot
- D. Lag plot

### Q4: What characterizes white noise in time series data?

- A. A clear upward trend
- B. Strong seasonality
- C. Zero autocorrelation at all lags
- D. High variance at specific time points

### Q5: In time series decomposition, when would you use a multiplicative model instead of an additive model?

- A. When the seasonal variation is roughly constant throughout the series
- B. When the seasonal variation increases over time
- C. When there is no trend in the data
- D. When the data contains negative values

### Q6: Which evaluation metric measures the size of the error in percentage terms?

- A. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- B. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- C. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- D. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

### Q7: What is the naive forecasting method?

- A. Using the average of all past observations as the prediction for the next period
- B. Using the value from the last period as the prediction for the next period
- C. Using linear regression to predict the next period
- D. Using machine learning algorithms to predict the next period

### Q8: What does the parameter 'd' represent in an ARIMA(p,d,q) model?

- A. The number of autoregressive terms
- B. The degree of differencing needed for stationarity
- C. The number of moving average terms
- D. The number of seasonal patterns

### Q9: In a SARIMA model, what does the parameter 'm' represent?

- A. The number of moving average terms
- B. The number of autoregressive terms
- C. The degree of differencing
- D. The number of periods in a season

### Q10: What is the advantage of using AutoARIMA or AutoETS over manually specifying model parameters?

- A. They always produce more accurate forecasts
- B. They automatically determine the best parameters based on information criteria
- C. They require less data to train
- D. They can only be used for seasonal data
